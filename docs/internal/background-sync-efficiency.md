# Background Sync Efficiency

This document records the runtime and cost-model contracts that keep active
session writers from turning into unbounded background work. The implementation
lives primarily in `internal/sync/watcher.go`,
`internal/parser/codex_cursor.go`, and the provider incremental path in
`internal/sync/engine.go`.

## Watcher runtime contract

- Production watcher events use a 500 ms first-event batching window. Later
  events join the pending set without postponing its deadline.
- Watcher callback start times are at least five seconds apart. One worker runs
  callbacks serially while the fsnotify loop continues draining events and
  errors, so a long sync cannot block event intake or overlap another sync.
- An idle watcher has no running timer or ticker. The first relevant event
  creates the next one-shot timer.
- Each pending or in-flight batch retains at most 8,192 unique paths and 2 MiB
  of path-string bytes. At most one batch is in flight while one more
  accumulates. Entry count separately bounds map and slice overhead.
- Exceeding either batch limit replaces its individual paths with one explicit
  full-sync marker. The worker clears event-sensitive freshness caches and
  force-verifies every discovered file under the same serialization,
  dispatch-floor, cancellation, and shutdown rules, so overflow bounds memory
  without losing same-stat source changes.
- Shutdown discards pending paths and waits only for an already-running
  callback. Normal discovery on the next startup recovers discarded changes.

## HTTP mirror journal contract

Persistent HTTP mirrors use the same 8,192-entry and 2 MiB path-byte limits for
their crash-recovery journal. Crossing either limit collapses the path set to a
full-import marker instead of retaining unbounded path data. Unlike an in-memory
watch batch, the marker is durable and remains until database processing and
remote skip-cache persistence complete.

For a proven changed source, classification, fingerprinting, parsing, and
database writes are independent of unrelated mirror cardinality. An unproven
path may widen work only to its owning provider's configured roots. Full archive
transfer caused by the half-manifest heuristic does not widen this import scope.

## Codex append cursor contract

The Codex provider factory owns one in-memory cursor cache shared by its
per-source provider instances. Its lifetime is the sync engine's lifetime; it is
not persisted across daemon restarts.

Each cursor is keyed by the cleaned physical path, exact safe byte offset, and
inode/device identity where the platform exposes them. The cache is an LRU
bounded to 256 entries and 2 MiB of estimated retained data. It contains compact
continuation state only: never parsed messages, raw JSON lines, complete prompt
bodies, file contents, or open file descriptors.

The database's committed source offset is the cursor commit token. A parse may
stage old- and new-offset entries, but only an exact offset from the next
database request is eligible. A failed database write therefore retries from the
old cursor; an unreachable staged entry is eventually evicted.

Every nonzero resume offset must immediately follow a newline. Incremental
parsing commits only complete, valid, newline-terminated JSONL records. Partial
records and valid JSON at a newline-less EOF are retried or force a full parse;
they are never published as safe cursor boundaries.

Truncation, known file-identity replacement, manual or project refreshes,
`session_index.jsonl` title changes, and records that retroactively update
stored messages all fall back to an authoritative full replacement. Safe
incremental writes preserve the index-folded mtime and lifecycle-derived
termination status alongside message and token aggregates.

## Append-only limitation

Cursor correctness assumes that growth is append-only. A same-inode file can
grow after bytes inside its already-committed prefix have been rewritten. Size,
identity, and boundary checks do not detect that case, and the current
full-source fingerprint is not compared with a separately verified stored prefix
before incremental parsing. Closing this gap would require rolling hash state or
explicit prefix verification and remains deferred.

## Cost model and regression evidence

A warm Codex cursor makes continuation-state parsing scale with appended records
rather than transcript history. End-to-end append sync is still O(file): the
provider's `Fingerprint` hashes the complete source and the engine's
`ComputeFileHashPrefix` hashes through the newly committed offset.

- `BenchmarkCodexIncrementalCursor` in `internal/parser` compares cold prefix
  reconstruction with the exact warm cursor. It is diagnostic because
  `internal/parser` is not in `BENCH_GATE_PACKAGES`.
- `BenchmarkCodexIncrementalSyncReads` in `internal/sync` measures the warm tail
  between the two remaining linear reads. It is PR-gated because
  `internal/sync` is in `BENCH_GATE_PACKAGES`.
