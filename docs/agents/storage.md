# Storage Rules

Read this file before changing SQLite, PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, DuckDB, archive
resync, or storage queries.

## SQLite Archive

SQLite is the persistent archive. Never delete, drop, truncate, or recreate it
to handle a data-version change.

Use non-destructive schema migrations such as `ALTER TABLE` and `UPDATE`. A
parser change that needs a full resync must build a fresh database, sync source
files, copy orphaned sessions from the old database, and swap the files
atomically. Preserve sessions even when their source files no longer exist.

## Backend Parity

- Keep observable behavior and query shape aligned between SQLite and
  PostgreSQL/CockroachDB when practical. Match queries, indexes, aggregations,
  filters, and ordering unless a documented constraint requires a difference.
- Do not fix correctness or performance in only one primary backend unless the
  user limits the task to that backend. If implementations must differ,
  explain why and preserve the same behavior.
- DuckDB is a derived mirror and is not part of this parity rule.

## DuckDB Mirror

- Treat DuckDB as a disposable read mirror of SQLite, never as a system of
  record. Deleting the mirror must lose nothing.
- Do not add in-place mirror migrations. A schema or source-data version change
  must bump `internal/duckdb.SchemaVersion`, rebuild a fresh file, validate
  it, and swap it atomically. Do not add `ALTER` migrations, version-bridging
  reads, or compatibility shims for old mirrors.
- Store every DuckDB push cursor and version in the mirror's `sync_metadata`.
  Never store DuckDB sync state in SQLite.
- Replace whole sessions during incremental updates and gate them with
  per-session fingerprints. Do not add per-table, per-column, or diff-based
  updates.
- Keep Quack read-only. `duckdb push` writes the local mirror; it never writes
  to a remote DuckDB service.
- Replace a file only after identifying it as an agentsview DuckDB mirror. Fail
  closed for unknown files.

## PostgreSQL Integration Tests

Run PostgreSQL integration tests only against a dedicated test database. The
tests create and drop the `agentsview` schema.

Use `make test-postgres` to start the test container and run the suite. It
leaves the container running. If you started that container, use
`make postgres-down` when it is no longer needed.

To use an existing dedicated instance, run:

```bash
TEST_PG_URL="postgres://user:pass@host:5432/dbname?sslmode=disable" \
  CGO_ENABLED=1 go test -tags "fts5,pgtest" ./internal/postgres/... -v
```
